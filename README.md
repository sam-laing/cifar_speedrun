# CIFAR10 speedrun mod

Investigating the effects of some HP choices of the Muon optimizer to truly understand it's effect on training dynamics and generally understanding the optimizer better. 

The training script was largely lifted from ![Keller Jordan's cifar10 speedrun repo]{https://github.com/KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench} in order to have a fast working implementation of Muon in all it's glory.

Code has been more modularized since i hate 700 line scripts:)
